1) Open colorcpl.
2) Find your affected monitor in the top drop-down list.
3) Uncheck "Use my settings for this device", if not already so.
4) Click on Advanced tab.
5) Click on "Change System Default" button. A new "System Defaults" window will show up. Note that this requires admin privilege. If you don't have admin privilege, let me know and I'll give you further steps on how to workaround the issue.
6) Find your affected display on the top drop-down, if you have multiple monitors hooked up.
7) Select the currently associated profiles. In most likelihood, there'll only be one profile.
8) Press "Remove". Note that this will only disassociate the profile from your display, not permanently remove it. (So you can still get back to the original state if you want to later on in time.)
9) Go to Advanced Tab.
10) Uncheck "Use Windows display calibration."
11) Close both colorcpl windows.
12) Reboot.
