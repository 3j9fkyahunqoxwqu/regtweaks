Normal procedure:
Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Programs and Features > Installed Updates

Or

Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Programs and Features Turn Windows features on/off


but this won't remove any packages by itself, so we must use this:



1. Open command prompt as administrator.

2. Copy and paste below command and press enter.

FORFILES /P %WINDIR%\servicing\Packages /M Microsoft-Windows-InternetExplorer-*11.*.mum /c "cmd /c echo Uninstalling package @fname && start /w pkgmgr /up:@fname /norestart"

If you get errors, just click okay, also ensure that you have take-ownership access to all %WINDIR%\servicing\Packages (or it will also shows errors about access denied)
