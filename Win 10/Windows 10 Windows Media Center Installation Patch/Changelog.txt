- this is mainly a dism-only pack, with additional few tweaks to facilitate the install, and copying the patched files
- all available lanuages are now installed by there dism packages
- added a workaround to prevent the system from restoring original non-patched files
- better support for Win8.1
- included simple script BackupRestoreSettings.cmd to save settings (registry and eHome folder from ProgramData)
uninstall script is also modded to not remove these settings (in case you needed a reinstall)
