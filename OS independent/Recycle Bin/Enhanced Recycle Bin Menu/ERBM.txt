Enhanced Recycle Bin Menu by Herby - herby.virtualplastic.net

ERBM+.reg replaces the Delete command from the Recycle Bin with a Clear Temp command.
This prevents users from accidentally deleting of the Recycle Bin Icon from the Desktop. :)
It also adds a Disk Cleanup command which performs an Extended Disc Cleanup on all disks.
The Clear Temp command clears both Temp dirs: %UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Temp\ and %SystemRoot%\Temp\.

Install: merge ERBM+.reg
Uninstall: merge ERBM-.reg
