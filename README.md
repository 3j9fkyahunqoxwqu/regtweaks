Regtweaks (Win 7 - Win 10) Collection files original created under the GNUv2 license 2015 by [CHEF-KOCH](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH). Some tweaks are taken from the internet, some are found by myself.


**Current Status: Over 600+ tweaks**


Before! you use any tweak(s) ensure you read the comment(s) inside the .reg (labeled with **;**) to see what it really changes. Of course an backup/snapshot could also help in case something goes wrong. Remember: Shit happens!



Project Goal
------------

1. All of the tweaks could be integrated into image creations tools (vLite, WinToolKit,..) to simplify things, especially if you like to re-install Windows from the ground without need to apply each tweak one by one.
2. Show hidden things that aren't visible via GUI under Windows. Sometimes it's easier/faster to do this via .reg instead of search for the toggles.
3. Another goal is that the user doesn't need additional tools like O&O ShutUp, because some of such 'Privacy' tools are bundled with bloatware and are not necessary, because all can already be done with scripts and .reg tweak - So overall an Index/Backup script to read the current state is more transparent (see 1/2).
4. Fix everything under ToDo.



Any problems, questions or something wrong?
------------

* Feel free to open an [issue ticket](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/regtweaks/issues) and I will look at it asap. - Pull requests or ideas are always welcome!
* Please do not use the issue tracker to ask for xyz tweaks, I not waste my time with that until there is a very good reasons to do so. If you found something that wasn't added here contact me and I will add it.
