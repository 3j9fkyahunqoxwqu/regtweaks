Regtweaks (Win 7 - Win 10) Collection files original created under the GNUv2 license 2015 by [CHEF-KOCH](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH). Some tweaks are taken from the www, some are found by myself.


**Current Status: Over 600+ tweaks**


Project Goal
------------

* All of the tweaks could be integrated into image creations tools (vLite, WinToolKit,..) to simplify things, especially if you like to re-install Windows from the ground without need to apply each tweak one by one.
* Show hidden things that aren't visible via GUI under Windows. Sometimes it's easier/faster to do this via .reg instead of search for the toggles.
* Fix everything under ToDo.



Any problems, questions or something wrong?
------------

* Feel free to open an [issue ticket](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/regtweaks/issues) and I will look at it asap. - Pull requests or ideas are always welcome!
